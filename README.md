# Categorize Numbers into Even or Odd

## Description
This Dart program takes a list of numbers, iterates through each number using a for-loop, and categorizes them as even or odd using a switch-case statement.

## Code Explanation
- A list of integers is defined.
- A for-loop is used to iterate through the list.
- The switch-case checks if the number is even (remainder 0) or odd (remainder 1).

## Output
When running the program, the output will display each number and its category (even or odd).

Example output:
1 is Odd
2 is Even
3 is Odd
4 is Even
10 is Even
23 is Odd
77 is Odd


## How to Run
1. Install Dart SDK.
2. Run the program using the command:
   ```bash
   dart run task2
